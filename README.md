# This is a project submitted by S. Aniruddha towards the course EE5120 Applied Linear Algebra.

I have reproduced the numerical results of the following paper: 

P. Fika and M. Mitrouli, “Estimation of the bilinear form y?f(A)x for Hermitian matrices”, Linear Algebra and its Applications, vol. 502, pp. 140–158, 2016.

## Files:

1. mhd1280b.mat

    MATLAB matrix data file downloaded from 
    [https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/NEP/mhd/mhd1280b.html](https://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/data/NEP/mhd/mhd1280b.html)

2. EP18B029_Aniruddha_EE5120_Project.mlx

    MATLAB Live Editor file containing MATLAB code and documentation for the project.
    *Note* : Please run the first 2 code cells before running any other code cell. They are 
             for importing the .mat matrix data file and to initialize the variables.
